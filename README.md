Name: Ninja Field Naruto Battle Card Application

Description: The following is a web application that allows you to add ninja characters from the anima "Naruto" and "Naruto Shippuden". Once added to the page you are able to filter the cards based on village. On hover over a card the card will flip and you will be presented with the option to add the card to squad one or squad two. Once you have the desired ninjas in each squad, maximum of three you, can select the fight button which will present you with the victor. After a winner is presented, the battlefield will reset after 5 seconds.

Installation:
    Fork and clone github repository. Install JSON Server globally on your machine by entering  npm install -g json-server into your terminal. Next start the JSON Server by running the following command from the same directory you cloned the github repository:  json-server --watch db.json. Once the Server is running you should be able to open the html document in your local browser to  initiate the web application.

Support: 
    If you have any questions or need any help with the application please email me at bigjj3393@yahoo.com.

Roadmap:
    Continuing to advance this application I have ideas to create an image selector for the battlefield with arrow buttons that cycle through multiple images. I also would like to include another filter that will filter through the selected village and/or the ninjas rank. I have thought of adding a small pop up gif when the fight button is clicked that will show a short clip of ninjas fighting. The final thought would be to have the hidden power of each ninja reset to another random number between 1-100 when they are included in the fight.
